# Hi, I'm Michael Melville ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a recent Biomedical Informatics graduate from The Ohio State University with 3+ years of research experience. 

- I briefly attended medical school before taking a leave to pursue a data-focused career.

# ðŸ“„ Purpose of This Portfolio

- If you're here, you're likely a recruiting or hiring manager looking for more context on my background. 

- I created this portfolio to share my journey with more detail and flow than a resume allows.

- Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!

# The Ohio State University

- Applying to medical school without taking a gap year is extremely challenging.

- I didn't feel financially secure enough to take a gap year, so I committed to applying straight to medical school.

- I entered OSU as a Biochemistry major.

- After working in the BBAL during the Spring semester of my , I discovered my passion for Statistics and Coding and started to explroe alternative majors.

- I really liked the Data Analytics major, but would've been unable to complete the full major alongside the pre-med requirements.

- I discovered the personalized study program (PSP), which allowed me to design my own interdiscplinary major (effectively letting me take as many data analytics courses as I could will still allowing me to graduate in 4 years)

- 


Working in the BBAL sparked my interest in statistics and coding, leading me to explore alternative majors.



- After joining the BBAL, I

Preparing for med school in 4 years is toughâ€”especially with a nontraditional major like Biomedical Informatics.

You canâ€™t be halfway in; the pre-med path is too demanding for divided focus.

I leaned into my interests by majoring in Biomedical Informatics and doing data-focused research.

I planned to eventually combine medicine and tech once I was practicing.

Financial pressure made a gap year feel out of reach.

Even with a scholarship, the weight of med school debt (at 8% interest) felt overwhelming.

The structure and pace of med school left little room to explore or integrate my data interests.

Medical education was far more rigid and consuming than I expected.

This article captures many of my reasons for stepping away.

- The medical school admissions process is extremely challenging to prepare for in 4 years (especially when completing a non-standard degree (e.g., not doing biology)

- You can't have one fit in the door and out the door and adequately prepare (its just too grueling)

- I incorporated my interests into the pre-med journey (majoring in Biomedical Informatics and doing data-oriented research)

- I told myself once I was practicing, I could transition into a path that allowed me to integrate medicien with technology

- I had personal financial pressures that made taking a gap-year feel not feasible

- Once I attended medical school, I had a scholarship but even with it, the sheer weight of student loans felt like a lot (especially at 8% interest rate)

- I felt unable to integrate my previous interests (data) into the path due to the rigor

- The medical school educaiton process is much different than what you anticipate

-  [This article](https://in-training.org/injecting-dose-creativity-medicine-10495) sums up my reasons pretty well

Iâ€™ve Been Doing Since Leaving Medical School

- Preparing for medical school is completely different from the job application process.

- They care heavily about your "Why?" so you become skilled at crafting a narrative and writing that narrative
