# Hi, I'm Michael Melville ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a recent Biomedical Informatics graduate from The Ohio State University with 3+ years of research experience. 

- I briefly attended medical school before taking a leave to pursue a data-focused career.


# ðŸ“„ Purpose of This Portfolio

- If you're here, you're likely a recruiting or hiring manager looking for more context on my background. 

- I created this portfolio to share my journey with more context, detail, and flow than a resume allows.

- Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!

# Why I Left Medical School

- Applying to medical school without taking a gap year is extremely demanding

  - Financial reasons made a gap year feel unfeasible for me
 
- I focused entirely on med school, which left little time for career exploration

I focused entirely on med school, leaving little time for career exploration

I aligned my interests by majoring in Biomedical Informatics and doing data-focused research

I planned to pursue medicine, then integrate tech into my practice or career path

- in 4 years is tough (especially with a nontraditional major like Biomedical Informatics)


Preparing for med school in 4 years is toughâ€”especially with a nontraditional major like Biomedical Informatics.

You canâ€™t be halfway in; the pre-med path is too demanding for divided focus.

I leaned into my interests by majoring in Biomedical Informatics and doing data-focused research.

I planned to eventually combine medicine and tech once I was practicing.

Financial pressure made a gap year feel out of reach.

Even with a scholarship, the weight of med school debt (at 8% interest) felt overwhelming.

The structure and pace of med school left little room to explore or integrate my data interests.

Medical education was far more rigid and consuming than I expected.

This article captures many of my reasons for stepping away.

- The medical school admissions process is extremely challenging to prepare for in 4 years (especially when completing a non-standard degree (e.g., not doing biology)

- You can't have one fit in the door and out the door and adequately prepare (its just too grueling)

- I incorporated my interests into the pre-med journey (majoring in Biomedical Informatics and doing data-oriented research)

- I told myself once I was practicing, I could transition into a path that allowed me to integrate medicien with technology

- I had personal financial pressures that made taking a gap-year feel not feasible

- Once I attended medical school, I had a scholarship but even with it, the sheer weight of student loans felt like a lot (especially at 8% interest rate)

- I felt unable to integrate my previous interests (data) into the path due to the rigor

- The medical school educaiton process is much different than what you anticipate

-  [This article](https://in-training.org/injecting-dose-creativity-medicine-10495) sums up my reasons pretty well

Iâ€™ve Been Doing Since Leaving Medical School

- Preparing for medical school is completely different from the job application process.

- They care heavily about your "Why?" so you become skilled at crafting a narrative and writing that narrative
